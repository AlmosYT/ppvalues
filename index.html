<h2>What is PPvalues?</h2>
    <p>PPvalues is a politcal test that tries to gauge your opinion on the different issues of PixelPlace. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the eight values?</h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Political, Moderation, Rules, and Diplomacy - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Reformist</b> (Political)<br/>
        Reformist players want to bring changes to the site: add new mods, change rules, or even the look of the site itself.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Conservative</b> (Political)<br/>
        Conservatives think that PixelPlace is good as it is and not a lot of change is needed.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Pro-Mod</b> (Moderation)<br/>
        Pro-Mod people support the current moderation team.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Anti-Mod</b> (Moderation)<br/>
        Anti-Mod people believe that the current moderation team is corrupt, in some way, and needs to be replaced.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Liberal</b> (Rules)<br/>
        These people believe that the rules are too strict, and that players should have the right to do anything they want, for example skipdot.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Anti-Dot</b> (Rules)<br/>
        Anti-Dot players believe that a clean-looking canvas they play on is more important then the liberty of the player.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Diplomatic</b> (Diplomacy)<br/>
        Diplomatic players believe that peace is sustainable, and that the factions should rather follow diplomatic principles for setteling disputes instead of agression and war.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Agressive</b> (Diplomacy)<br/>
        Agressive players believe that war can not be avoided in a land dispute, and its better to get it over with then negotiate.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
